Multipoint Optimization
***********************

Introduction
============
Optimization does not have to be limited to a single flight condition. 
This section goes through the same optimization as the single point case, except with one more flight condition. 
Instead of rewriting the code from scratch, the differences in code will be pointed out.


Files
=====

Navigate to the directory ``airfoilopt/multipoint`` in your tutorial folder. 
Copy the FFD file, ``ffd.xyz``, and the CGNS mesh file, ``n0012.cgns``, generated previously, into the directory:

.. prompt:: bash

    cp ../mesh/n0012.cgns . 
    cp ../ffd/ffd.xyz . 

Copy the singlepoint script from the previous section to a new file in this directory:

.. prompt:: bash

    cp ../singlepoint/airfoil_opt.py airfoil_multiopt.py


Highlighting the changes required in the multipoint optimization script
=======================================================================
Open the file ``airfoil_multiopt.py`` in your favorite text editor.
Change the following sections for multipoint optimization.

Specifying parameters for the optimization
------------------------------------------

For multipoint optimization, the parameters have to be specified in lists of the same size.

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorial/airfoilopt/multipoint/airfoil_multiopt.py
    :start-after: # rst parameters (beg)
    :end-before: # rst parameters (end)


Set the AeroProblem
-------------------

For more than one AeroProblem, a list needs to be created. 
Each AeroProblem is created with the respective optimization point and appended to the list.

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorial/airfoilopt/multipoint/airfoil_multiopt.py
    :start-after: # rst aeroproblem (beg)
    :end-before: # rst aeroproblem (end)


Optimization callback functions
-------------------------------
The same for-loop needs to be added to the callback functions. 
The lines that require a call to the an AeroProblem is now put into a for-loop to iterate through all of them.


.. literalinclude:: ../tutorial/airfoilopt/multipoint/airfoil_multiopt.py
    :start-after: # rst funcs (beg)
    :end-before: # rst funcs (end)

In the ``objCon`` function, the :math:`c_L` constraint is also placed into the for-loop.

Optimization problem
--------------------

Adding the constraints to the optimization problem requires adding them to each AeroProblem.

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorial/airfoilopt/multipoint/airfoil_multiopt.py
    :start-after: # rst optprob (beg)
    :end-before: # rst optprob (end)


Run it yourself!
================

The script can be run in the same way

.. prompt:: bash

    mkdir output
    mpirun -np 4 python airfoil_multiopt.py | tee output.txt
