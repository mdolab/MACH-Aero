Airfoil Optimization
####################
In this part of the tutorial, we will go through an example of an airfoil optimization. The process is similar to that of the previous sections, but less complicated.

Here are a few of the items we will cover in the following pages:

    - Generate an airfoil mesh to be used for optimization

    - Parametrize the 2D airfoil using the Free-form Deformation method

    - Run a single-point aerodynamic shape optimization

    - Run a multi-point aerodynamic shape optimization
