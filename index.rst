MACH-Aero Framework
===================
MACH-Aero is a framework for performing gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization.
It consists of the following core modules:

- `baseClasses <https://mdolab-baseclasses.readthedocs-hosted.com>`_ defines Python classes used by the other packages
- `pySpline <https://mdolab-pyspline.readthedocs-hosted.com>`_ is a B-spline implementation used by the other packages
- `pyGeo <https://mdolab-pygeo.readthedocs-hosted.com>`_ is a module for geometry manipulation and constraint formulation
- `IDWarp <https://mdolab-idwarp.readthedocs-hosted.com>`_ performs mesh warping using an inverse distance method
- `ADflow <https://mdolab-adflow.readthedocs-hosted.com>`_ is a 2nd-order finite volume CFD solver with an efficient adjoint implementation
- `pyOptSparse <https://mdolab-pyoptsparse.readthedocs-hosted.com>`_ is an optimization framework which provides a unified interface to several popular optimizers

And the following optional modules:

- `pyHyp <https://mdolab-pyhyp.readthedocs-hosted.com>`_ is a hyperbolic mesh generation tool used as a preprocessing step
- `multiPoint <https://mdolab-multipoint.readthedocs-hosted.com>`_ facilitates distributed multipoint optimization and handles the parallel communication using MPI
- `cgnsUtilities <https://github.com/mdolab/cgnsutilities>`_ is a command-line tool that allows carrying out several simple mesh manipulation operations on CGNS grids
- `DAFoam <https://dafoam.github.io/>`_ provides efficient adjoint implementations for OpenFOAM to be used for CFD instead of ADflow
